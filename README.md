## Installation.

1.  Clone this repository to `.dotfiles` in your home directory. The repository

        git clone https://github.com/shvenkat/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles \
        && cd ~/.dotfiles

2.  Run `make all` to install all apps, fonts and config.

    dotfiles and config files for (GUI) apps; `make apps` and `make fonts` are
    among the other available subsets.
