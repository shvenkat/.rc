At home, anywhere.

# Installation.

1.  Clone this repository to `.dotfiles` in your home directory. The repository
    URL is https://github.com/shvenkat/dotfiles.

        git clone https://github.com/shvenkat/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles \
        && cd ~/.dotfiles

2.  Run the installer: `./install`.

    The installer uses `fresh` to install dotfiles, `homebrew`/`linuxbrew` to
    install utilities/apps, and a custom utility to set OS preferences. These
    dependencies are automatically managed.
