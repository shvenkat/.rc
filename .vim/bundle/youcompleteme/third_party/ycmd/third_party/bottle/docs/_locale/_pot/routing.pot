msgid "The :class:`Router` distinguishes between two basic types of routes: **static routes** (e.g. ``/contact``) and **dynamic routes** (e.g. ``/hello/<name>``). A route that contains one or more *wildcards* it is considered dynamic. All other routes are static."

msgid "The simplest form of a wildcard consists of a name enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. ``<name>``). The name should be unique for a given route and form a valid python identifier (alphanumeric, starting with a letter). This is because wildcards are used as keyword arguments for the request callback later."
