"Bottle comes with a fast, powerful and easy to learn built-in template "
"engine called *SimpleTemplate* or *stpl* for short. It is the default engine"
" used by the :func:`view` and :func:`template` helpers but can be used as a "
"stand-alone general purpose template engine too. This document explains the "
"template syntax and shows examples for common use cases."
